problem 1 list files in reverse order         ls -r

problem 2  remove multiple files  		    rm *.txt *.doc  		echo 'hello' >> a.txt adds at the end of file while echo 'hello' > a.txt removes all previous and adds hello

problem 3  output multiple files with one command        cat example*.txt

problem 4  if talking about hello in file name use       cp *hello* ./IITG/

problem 4  if talking about hello inside the file use   cp `grep -l "hello" examples*.txt` /home/arpit/CS_241/IITG

problem 5  list all files not ending with z andd a    ls --ignore="*a" --ignore="*z"      ls --ignore="*[a,z]" 	correct answer ls --ignore="*[a,z]" --ignore="*[A-Z]"

problem 6  space occupied by current directory along with all its sub directories        du -h  directory name

problem 7  count the number of lines in all files of particuar format       wc -l *.c

Q.8 

	part1=  go in the root by sudo su
		
		groupadd <groupname>(group1)
		useradd -d /home/abhishek(directory will be made by me) -g group1 -m <username>(abhishek)
		passwd abhishek(to set the password)

	part2= to record home directly
		make a file file1.txt
		cat /etc/passwd| grep abhishek>>file1.txt (home directly will be written in abhishek)
		id abhishek>>file1.txt( to store id and group)

	part3= useradd -d /home/abhishek/second_home_user -g group1 -m rishi(and previously do the follow up commands)

	part4= just use the follow up commands
		to record, ls -al | cat>>record.txt

Q.9

	part1= usermod -l <newname> <oldname>
	part2= groupmod -n <newname> <oldname>
	part3= usermod -d <newDir>(oldDir will be overwritten) -m <username>(the name of user whose id you wanna change)
	part4= cat /etc/passwd file open...
		
		cse:x:1001:1001:Priyanshu:/home/cse:/bin/bash (this /bin/bash is shell)

		usermod -s /home/nologin <username>(sakshi)

Q.10

	part1= userdel sakshi
	part2= userdel -r rishi(deletes even directory)
	part3= groupdel <groupname>

Q.11 cat /var/log/syslog --> to see syslog
	
	cat /var/log/auth.log --> to see login details(failed password attempt will result in authentication failure)


Q.12 part1-->  tar -tf <filename>.tar
		to create a tar file use tar -cvf a.tar filename(you want to convert to tar)

     part2-->  split the file using   split -b 10K(or any file size you want) filename "name you want(let it be gu)"
	       then to join these parts cat gu*> <filename>(let it be lecture 1).tar( it will again join these split files in a new tar)
	       tar -xvf <filename>(ex:lecture1.tar) -C <directory>(/home/cse) --> extract in a specific directory

Q.14 

	part 1:	

	PARTED:
		go into root
		lsblk--> see all the partitions(including pen drive)
		umount /dev/sdbx - unmount each partition of pendrive individually(if 3 partiton umount 3 times)
		go and see in lsblk -- mountpoint will be gone in /dev/sdbx
		
		type parted(it's a application for doing partition)
		by default it will be /dev/sda
		select /dev/sdb --> to change into drive(the pen drive drive)
		do print(it will partition table)
		mklabel/mktable--> partition table and partition is gone
		mkpart--> make new partition table, fat32 or ext2
		table type is gpt(aka gupta)
		
		resizepart--> only end will change
		rm --> remove partiton
		unit--> select the unit in which u wanna show the partition size
		if after resizepart we put end at some negative no--> we get completely to the end
		

	FDISK(hard drive partiton making tool):

		each sector made is of 1/2 kb, tell the start sector, and tell the end sector
		no resize option is present
		Until and unless you write in fdsik(by command w),there will be no changes in drive

	MKFS(make file system/ format job):
		
		mkfs.vfat(vfat is format type|| ntfs is another) /dev/sdbx(format each partition individually)

	
Q.15 
	PART1:
	dd if=(space mat de idhar)<address>(ex: /home/cse/Desktop/<filename>.iso) of=<address of sdb>(ex: /dev/sdb)
	if here is input, of being output

	PART2:
	replace if with of
	dd if=/dev/sdcx of=/home/cse/Desktop/aspgu.iso

	PART3:

	DO ALL THIS IN ROOT

	mkdir /media/iso(go to media by cd .., then again see ls)	
	ToMount--->	mount -o loop <location where media iso is(part2 mein jo of tha)>(ex:/home/cse/Desktop/arpgu.iso) /media/iso

	UnMOunt--->     umount /media/iso/ (do it from home,,, like after wherever u are, do cd and then do this)

Q.16
	command to make softlink -->
	to see arrow use ls -al

	ln -s <address of folder to create softlink>(ex: /home/cse/Desktop/CS110 <filename>(ex: newname)
	ln -s a c	creates a softlink c to a

fdisk does not support gpt type table
in fdisk we need to use w whereas in parted in does automatically

first go parted /dev/sdb1
problem 14 part 1			first convert loop to gpt	mklabel	
					to partition			mkpart ->primary ext2 start end
	part 2				to create multiple partitions   fdisk /dev/sdb1 --> n-> number-->start and end
	
	part 3				use 				resizepart 
	part 4 				to remove using parted use 	rm
					to remove using fdisk use	d then number
